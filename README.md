# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life consists of a grid of square cells, each of which is in two possible states, alive  or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

  

## Rules
  

Each turn in the game is a new generation of cells. At each generation the following changes occur:

  

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
